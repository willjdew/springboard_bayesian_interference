    "In the last two subunits, you've encountered two schools for performing inference from samples. The Frequentist school calls upon a body of theory established over the past couple of centuries or so. Under certain assumptions and conditions, this allows us to calculate what we would expect to see if an experiment were to be repeated again and again and again. The expected value of the average of a sample is one such statistic we can calculate a result for, even if the originating distribution is far from normal. The bootstrap school, on the other hand, literally does (virtually) run that experiment again and again and again and empirically observes the multitude of outcomes. It then empirically calculates a statistic of interest. While this can be for exactly the same statistics that frequentism calculates (e.g. the mean of a sample) this empirical approach can also perform inference on statistics that do not have well known sampling distributions. Because of the requirement to repeat many, many redraws (with replacement) from the sample, this approach only became feasible with modern computing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "And thus we come to the Bayesian school of inference. Here we frame our probabilities not so much in terms of \"how many times would I expect this event to occur if the experiment were to be rerun many times\" but rather in terms of \"what is my belief in the likelihood of this event occurring?\" In a Bayesian probabilistic programming context, we can build models for systems and then let the data tell us how likely certain values for our model parameters are. This can be a very useful way to incorporate prior knowledge and deal with limited data. It can just be more than a _little_ fiddly to produce a good model!"

    "For the final mini-project of the stats unit, you'll once again return to the medical charge data you've used for the other mini-projects. Previously, we considered whether we believed that the actual average(non-insured) charge had fallen below a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hospital is now reviewing its financial resiliency plan, which requires a model for revenue under a range of conditions that include the number of patients treated. Its current model is based on a confidence interval for the mean, and scaling that by different numbers of patients for each scenario. This approach has a number of limitations, most acutely the breakdown of the central limit theorem for low patient volumes; the current model does not do a good job of reflecting the variability in revenue you would see as the number of cases drops. A bootstrap approach would return samples of the same size as the original. Taking subsamples would restrict the sampling to the values already present in the original sample and would not do a good job of representing the actual variability you might see. What is needed is a better model of individual charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the problem here is that we want to model the distribution of individual charges and _we also really want to be able to capture our uncertainty about that distribution_ so we can better capture the range of values we might see. This naturally leads us to a powerful, probabilistic approach — we'll use the pymc3 library to perform Bayesian inference."

    "Well it doesn't look too bad! We're not a million miles off. But can we do better? We have a plausible form for the distribution of charge amounts and potential values for that distribution's parameters so we can already draw random variates from that distribution to perform simulations. But we don't know if we have a _best_ estimate for the population parameters, and we also only have a single estimate each for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$; we aren't capturing our uncertainty in their values. Can we take a Bayesian inference approach to estimate the parameters?"

Similarly, use an exponential prior for the rate ([$1/\\beta$](https://wiki.analytica.com/index.php?title=Gamma_distribution)) parameter in PyMC3's [Gamma](https://docs.pymc.io/api/distributions/continuous.html#pymc3.distributions.continuous.Gamma). Call this stochastic variable `rate_` (but it will be supplied as `pm.Gamma`'s `beta` parameter).

    "In this exercise, we have postulated a distribution to describe the individual charge amounts for non-insured cases. This distribution has two required parameters, which we do not know, but we used PyMC3 to perform Bayesian inference to find our level of \"belief\" in a range of values for them. We then used the average parameter values to create one simulated data set of the same size as the original, but the distribution of our posteriors for these parameters will allow us to perform simulations of any sample size we desire and for a range of scenarios of different $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. This could be a powerful tool to model different financial conditions for the hospital. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well done making it through this tricky subject. Starting think Bayesian _and_ starting to get to grips with something like PyMC3 is no easy task. As a data scientist, the most important thing is to be aware that this statistical approach exists, though you may not actually use this approach as much as you use the other approaches you've learned about. Still, we encourage you to think of ways that this approach could apply to the work that you do in this course and throughout your career.  "
